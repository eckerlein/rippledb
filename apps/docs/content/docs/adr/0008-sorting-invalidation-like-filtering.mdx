title: "ADR-0008: Sorting Requires the Same Invalidation Strategy as Filtering"
description: Any change to fields used for sorting invalidates and reruns list queries.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Sorting changes row ordering and pagination boundaries. A field change used in ORDER BY may reorder the entire list.

## Decision

Sorting is treated identically to filtering:

- any change to dependent entities invalidates the list query
- list queries are rerun entirely

## Alternatives Considered

- Incremental reorder logic
- Partial re-sorting

## Consequences

- Consistent behavior across filters and sorts
- Simplified mental model
- Predictable pagination correctness
