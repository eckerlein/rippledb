title: "ADR-0016: store-* and db-* Packages Own Backend/Runtime Dependencies"
description: Runtime-specific deps (SQLite, Postgres, etc.) must live outside core/client/server in store-* and db-* packages.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Concrete implementations require dependencies (SQLite driver, Postgres client, etc.). We want to avoid pulling these into the core dependency tree.

## Decision

All runtime-/backend-specific dependencies live in persistence packages, for example:

- `@converge/store-sqlite`
- `@converge/db-postgres`

Core/orchestration packages depend only on interfaces, never on implementations:

- `@converge/core`, `@converge/client`, `@converge/server` **must not** depend on any `store-*` or `db-*` package.

## Alternatives Considered

- A single `@converge/adapters` package
- Core selecting implementations via optional dependencies

## Consequences

- Users install only what they need
- Dependency tree stays clean
- Clear responsibility separation
