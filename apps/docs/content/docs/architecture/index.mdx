This section is the “base doc”, split into focused pages so it’s easier to read and keep up to date.

If you want the **canonical decision log**, see the [ADRs](/docs/adr).

## Canonical mental model

> Local storage is truth  
> Replication is log-based  
> Conflicts resolve per field  
> Row queries are precise  
> List queries are rerun  
> Sorting requires rerun  
> Performance comes from batching  
> Reactivity is explicit  
> Magic is avoided
