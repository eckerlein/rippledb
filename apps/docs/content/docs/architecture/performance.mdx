title: Performance via Batching
description: Solve N+1 by batching reads per tick/RAF without coupling to UI frameworks.

## 13. Batching (performance without magic)

### 13.1 The problem

Normalized access patterns cause many reads:

```ts
getInquiry(id)
getCustomer(customerId)
getAssignee(assigneeId)
```

Naively, this is N+1 DB queries.

### 13.2 The solution: batch loader

We batch **reads**, not invalidations.

### 13.3 Batch loader contract

```ts
interface BatchLoader<K, V> {
  load(key: K): Promise<V | null>;
}
```

Behavior:

- collects keys during a tick / RAF
- deduplicates
- executes one `WHERE id IN (...)`
- splits results back to callers

### 13.4 Critical property

The batch loader:

- does **not** know about TanStack Query
- does **not** know about UI
- lives in the data access layer

Any caller benefits.
