title: Package Structure & Dependency Rules
description: How the monorepo is layered, why store-* vs db-* exists, and the dependency graph we enforce.
---

This page locks in how we organize Converge as a monorepo so the core stays portable and we don’t accidentally couple the system to one runtime, database, or UI framework.

## The key split: client vs server persistence

Converge has *two* categories of “backend” implementations that must not be blurred:

- **Client-side local truth**: the database the UI reads from, updated transactionally via replication.
  - packages: `@converge/store-*`
- **Server-side persistence**: the system that accepts changes and serves cursorable incremental history (and may materialize domain tables).
  - packages: `@converge/db-*`

If the names don’t encode this split, contributors will mix responsibilities and the design will erode.

## Layered package set (v0)

### Foundation

- `@converge/core`
  - HLC, tags, Change types, merge/apply helpers (pure logic)

### Orchestration (no database drivers)

- `@converge/client`
  - client sync orchestration (outbox, pull/apply/push), policies, stream handling
- `@converge/server`
  - server interfaces/helpers for append + cursor pull, policies

### Client truth stores

- `@converge/store-sqlite`
- `@converge/store-memory` (tests)
- later: `@converge/store-indexeddb`, etc.

### Server persistence

- `@converge/db-postgres`
- `@converge/db-sqlite` (dev/tests)
- later: `@converge/db-dynamodb`, etc.

### UI bindings (optional)

- `@converge/bind-tanstack`
  - DbEvent → invalidateQueries, list registry, invalidation coalescing

## Dependency graph (must hold)

- `@converge/core` → depends on nothing (or only tiny pure deps)
- `@converge/client`, `@converge/server` → depend on `@converge/core`
- `@converge/store-*` → depend on `@converge/core` (and optionally `@converge/client` interfaces)
- `@converge/db-*` → depend on `@converge/core` (and optionally `@converge/server` interfaces)
- `@converge/bind-*` → depends on `@converge/core` types + its UI library; **never required by core/client/server**

To keep this true over time, we should enforce it with workspace constraints or lint rules.
