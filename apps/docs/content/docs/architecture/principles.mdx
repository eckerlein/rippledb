## 3. Core philosophy (non-negotiable)

### 3.1 Local storage is truth

- All canonical state lives in **durable local storage**
- In-memory state is always **derived**
- The UI never “owns” data

Why:

- correctness offline
- debuggability
- deterministic replay
- no hidden state

### 3.2 Replication is log-based, not state-based

- We sync **changes**, not snapshots
- Logs are append-only
- Pull uses cursors

Why:

- robustness
- easy recovery
- multi-device consistency

### 3.3 Conflict resolution must be deterministic

- No heuristics
- No “best effort”
- Same inputs → same outputs everywhere

We use **field-level LWW with HLC tags**.

### 3.4 UI reactivity is explicit

- No implicit dependency graphs
- No magic “join reactivity”
- Invalidation rules are **declared**, not inferred

Why:

- predictability
- testability
- portability across frameworks

### 3.5 Performance comes from batching, not cleverness

- We batch reads
- We rerun queries
- We avoid incremental complexity

Why:

- complexity kills correctness
- SQLite is fast
- rerunning queries is cheaper than guessing
