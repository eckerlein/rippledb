title: "ADR-0006: Row Queries Are Invalidated Precisely by ID"
description: Row queries invalidate by primary key; list queries use broader invalidation.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Row queries fetch a single entity by ID. Their membership does not change unless the entity is deleted.

## Decision

Row queries are invalidated **precisely**:

- update → invalidate `["entity", id]`
- delete → invalidate and remove cached row

## Alternatives Considered

- Broad invalidation for all queries
- Row dependency graphs

## Consequences

- Minimal re-fetching
- High performance for detail views
- Requires reliable DbEvent emission
