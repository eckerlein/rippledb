title: "ADR-0009: Performance Is Achieved via Batched Reads, Not Join-Based Reactivity"
description: Avoid client-side join reactivity; batch point reads into bulk queries per tick.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Normalized data access patterns cause many point reads (N+1 problem). Using client-side joins introduces invalidation complexity.

## Decision

Converge introduces a **batch loader** abstraction:

- reads are collected per tick/RAF
- executed as a single bulk query
- results are split back to callers

Batching is independent of UI frameworks or caches.

## Alternatives Considered

- Client-side joins
- In-memory materialized views
- Reactive data graphs

## Consequences

- Performance comparable to joins
- Simple invalidation model
- Works across all callers (UI, services, background tasks)
