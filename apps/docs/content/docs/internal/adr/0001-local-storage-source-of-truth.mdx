title: "ADR-0001: Local Storage Is the Source of Truth"
description: Durable local storage is canonical on the client; UI state is derived from it.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

RippleDB is intended to support offline-first and multi-user applications. The system must remain correct when the network is unavailable and must rippledb deterministically across replicas.

A decision is required on whether canonical state lives:

- in memory
- on the server
- or in durable local storage

## Decision

RippleDB treats **durable local storage as the source of truth** on the client.

All UI state is derived from local storage. In-memory caches (e.g. UI caches) are explicitly non-authoritative.

## Alternatives Considered

- In-memory truth with persistence layer (TinyBase-style)
- Server-authoritative state with local cache
- Hybrid memory + disk authority

## Consequences

- Offline correctness is guaranteed
- Debugging and inspection are easier
- Memory usage is predictable
- UI reactivity must be explicitly wired
- Persistence logic is unavoidable but centralized
