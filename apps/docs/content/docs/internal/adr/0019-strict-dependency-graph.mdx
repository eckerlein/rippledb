title: "ADR-0019: Strict Dependency Graph Between Packages"
description: Enforce a strict package dependency graph to prevent architectural erosion.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Even with multiple packages, accidental imports can break layering and portability.

## Decision

We enforce the following dependency graph:

- `@rippledb/core`
  - depends on nothing (or only tiny pure deps)
- `@rippledb/client` and `@rippledb/server`
  - depend on `@rippledb/core`
- `@rippledb/store-*`
  - depend on `@rippledb/core` (and optionally `@rippledb/client` interfaces)
- `@rippledb/db-*`
  - depend on `@rippledb/core` (and optionally `@rippledb/server` interfaces)
- `@rippledb/bind-*`
  - depend on `@rippledb/core` (for types like `DbEvent`) and on their UI library
  - must not be required by core/client/server

## Alternatives Considered

- Free-form dependency structure
- Everything depends on everything

## Consequences

- Prevents architectural erosion
- Enables use in many environments
- Requires linting or workspace constraints (recommended)
