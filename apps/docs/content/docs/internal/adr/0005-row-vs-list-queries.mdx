title: "ADR-0005: Distinguish Row Queries from List Queries"
description: Row queries and list queries have fundamentally different invalidation semantics.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Different query types have fundamentally different invalidation semantics.

Treating all queries uniformly leads to either stale data or excessive invalidation complexity.

## Decision

RippleDB explicitly distinguishes:

- **Row queries** (fetch by primary key)
- **List queries** (WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN, aggregates, pagination)

Each category has its own invalidation strategy.

## Alternatives Considered

- Uniform query treatment
- Automatic dependency graph inference
- Reactive joins

## Consequences

- Invalidation logic becomes simpler
- Developers must classify queries correctly
- Enables predictable correctness guarantees
