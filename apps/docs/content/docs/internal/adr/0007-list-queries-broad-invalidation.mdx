title: "ADR-0007: List Queries Use Broad Invalidation and Rerun"
description: List queries rerun broadly on dependent entity changes for correctness and simplicity.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

List queries may contain:

- WHERE clauses
- ORDER BY clauses
- JOINs
- aggregates
- pagination

Without parsing SQL or re-implementing query logic in JS, it is impossible to determine whether a change affects list membership or ordering.

## Decision

RippleDB **always invalidates and reruns list queries broadly** when dependent entities change.

Precision is intentionally sacrificed for correctness and simplicity.

## Alternatives Considered

- SQL AST parsing
- Query DSL with JS evaluation
- Incremental view maintenance
- In-memory reactive joins

## Consequences

- Lists are always correct
- Some refetches are unnecessary but safe
- Complexity is dramatically reduced
- Performance relies on DB efficiency and batching
