title: "ADR-0015: Core Package Must Be Pure and Dependency-Minimal"
description: "@converge/core contains only pure logic/types and must not depend on UI, runtime APIs, or DB drivers."
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The core package is the foundation. If it depends on environment-specific libraries (TanStack Query, Node APIs, SQLite drivers), the whole ecosystem becomes coupled and less reusable.

## Decision

`@converge/core` must:

- contain only pure logic and types
- have no dependency on UI libraries
- have no dependency on runtime-specific APIs (Node, DOM)
- have no dependency on database drivers

## Alternatives Considered

- Core includes adapters and integrations
- Core includes a default SQLite implementation

## Consequences

- Maximum portability
- Smaller surface area
- Adapters live in separate packages
