title: "ADR-0017: UI Integrations Live in bind-* Packages"
description: Cache invalidation wiring is UI-specific; ship it as optional bind-* packages (e.g. bind-tanstack-query).
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Invalidation wiring is cache/UI-specific and not part of the replication core. However, we want to provide a blessed integration for common stacks.

## Decision

UI/caching integration is shipped as separate packages, for example:

- `@rippledb/bind-tanstack-query`

Responsibilities include:

- DbEvent → `invalidateQueries` wiring
- list registry helper
- coalescing of invalidation bursts

Core packages must not import these. For a higher-level experience that combines these bindings with CRUD controllers, see the `@rippledb/client-query` package.

## Alternatives Considered

- Core bundles a UI cache
- UI integration lives inside persistence packages

## Consequences

- No framework lock-in
- Integrations can evolve independently
- Additional package to install for UI users
