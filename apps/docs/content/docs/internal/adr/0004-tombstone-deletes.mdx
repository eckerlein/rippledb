title: "ADR-0004: Deletes Are Modeled as Tombstones"
description: Deletes are conflict-resolvable fields (deleted + deleted_tag) rather than hard row removal.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Concurrent delete/update scenarios can cause “resurrection” if deletes are treated as row removal.

## Decision

Deletes are represented as **tombstones**:

- `deleted = true`
- `deleted_tag = <hlc>`

Deletes participate in LWW like any other field.

## Alternatives Considered

- Hard deletes
- Server-only deletes
- Per-row delete markers without tags

## Consequences

- Deletes are conflict-resolvable
- Resurrection is prevented
- Queries must filter on `deleted`
- Cleanup/compaction is a future concern
