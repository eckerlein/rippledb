title: "ADR-0012: CRDTs Are Explicitly Out of Core Scope"
description: CRDT semantics are not in core; integrate separately via optional modules if needed.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

CRDTs (e.g. Yjs) solve different problems than LWW-based relational sync.

Mixing CRDT semantics into the core would complicate guarantees and APIs.

## Decision

RippleDB does **not** include CRDT logic in the core.

CRDTs may be integrated later via:

- separate controllers
- separate persistence
- separate transports

## Alternatives Considered

- CRDT-only system
- Hybrid LWW/CRDT core

## Consequences

- Core remains simple and deterministic
- Rich text and presence require additional modules
- Future extensibility is preserved
