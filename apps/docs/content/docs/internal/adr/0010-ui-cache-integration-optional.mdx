title: "ADR-0010: UI Cache Integration Is Optional and Decoupled"
description: Core emits neutral DbEvents; UI cache integration is provided via optional adapters.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Different applications use different UI frameworks and caching strategies. The core library must not depend on a specific UI solution.

## Decision

RippleDB:

- emits neutral `DbEvent`s from the write path
- provides **optional UI integration helpers**
- does not couple core logic to TanStack Query or any framework

## Alternatives Considered

- Built-in UI cache
- Framework-specific core APIs

## Consequences

- Core remains portable
- UI integration requires explicit wiring
- Multiple UI adapters can coexist
