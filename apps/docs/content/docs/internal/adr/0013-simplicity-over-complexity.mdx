title: "ADR-0013: Complexity Is Rejected in Favor of Predictability"
description: Prefer simple rerun-based correctness and defer optimizations until proven necessary.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Many potential optimizations introduce significant complexity and hidden failure modes.

## Decision

When choosing between:

- complex incremental optimization
- simple rerun-based correctness

Converge **chooses simplicity and correctness**.

Optimizations are deferred until proven necessary.

## Alternatives Considered

- Aggressive optimization
- Smart diffing
- Query introspection

## Consequences

- Easier reasoning
- Fewer edge-case bugs
- Acceptable performance for intended use cases

## Final Note (Meta-ADR)

> Any future change that contradicts one of these ADRs **must introduce a new ADR** explaining why the original decision no longer holds.
>
> This is how the architecture stays coherent.
