title: "ADR-0003: Field-Level LWW Using Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)"
description: Resolve conflicts per-field using HLC tags rather than row-level LWW.
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Concurrent updates to the same entity fields must resolve deterministically across replicas.

Row-level “last write wins” causes unnecessary data loss and conflicts.

## Decision

RippleDB resolves conflicts using **field-level Last-Write-Wins**, ordered by **Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) tags**.

Each mutable field has its own tag:

```
wallMs:counter:nodeId
```

## Alternatives Considered

- Row-level LWW
- Vector clocks
- CRDTs for all data
- Server-side conflict resolution

## Consequences

- Deterministic rippledbnce
- Reduced conflict scope
- Increased schema verbosity (tags per field)
- Requires careful delete modeling (tombstones)
