description: What Converge is, what it is not, and the deliberate non-goals.

## 0. Purpose of this document

This document describes the **complete design** of the Converge library:

- what problems it solves
- what problems it explicitly does **not** solve
- the mental model
- the data flow
- the invalidation strategy
- the batching strategy
- how complex filtering/sorting is handled
- how UI frameworks integrate (without coupling)
- why broad invalidation is intentional
- how this compares to TinyBase-style systems

This is a **library perspective**, not an application template.

## 1. What Converge is

Converge is a **local-first replication core** built around:

- **durable local storage as the source of truth**
- **append-only change logs**
- **deterministic conflict resolution (LWW + HLC)**
- **explicit invalidation**
- **batched reads**
- **framework-agnostic UI integration**

It is designed for:

- relational domain data
- offline-first apps
- multi-user sync
- large, sortable/filterable tables
- predictable performance and correctness

## 2. What Converge is not

Converge is **not**:

- a database
- an ORM
- a UI state manager
- a CRDT engine
- a hosted backend
- a real-time transport guarantee

Converge **does not**:

- try to “understand SQL”
- parse WHERE clauses
- incrementally maintain arbitrary joins
- auto-optimize list membership

These are deliberate non-goals.
