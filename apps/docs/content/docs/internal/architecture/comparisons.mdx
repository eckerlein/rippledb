description: Relationship to TinyBase, and why CRDT/rich-text is intentionally outside core.

## 16. Relationship to TinyBase

### TinyBase strengths

- in-memory truth
- reactive joins
- fine-grained updates

### RippleDB strengths

- durable local truth
- SQL-grade filtering/sorting
- predictable performance
- simpler mental model
- scalable datasets

RippleDB trades:

- automatic reactive joins

for:

- explicit invalidation + rerun

This is intentional.

## 17. CRDT / rich text (out of core)

CRDT (e.g. Yjs) is:

- different conflict model
- different persistence model
- different UI needs

Therefore:

- not part of core
- integrated via separate controller later
